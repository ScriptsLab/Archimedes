The life and myths of Archimedes told by the invading Roman Solidiers and Generals


What happens when the Gladiator's army takes on the might of Harry Potters wizardry?  Archimedes and the Fall of Syracuse.   Archimedes is one of the greatest minds of human history who's ability for reason was so far beyond his day, his feats are regarded nothing less the real magic.  Marcellus, the Roman general who layed siege on Syracuse is Roman histories greatest General having been the only General to accomplish feats the Romans considered only to exist in the myths.   Archimedes the Movie will bring into focus the magic of growing up ,the simple wizardry of Mathematics, and the simple universal truths of life against the heroics of the invading Roman solidiers for a final show down of brains versus brawn.


<b>Extra Background:</b> Archimides' life is a deep complex moment in history between ancient western societies and newly encountered eastern countries not well covered in any single treatment. Archimedes life is largely mythical but what is known about him tells us of a gifted singular genious with a fixation for the purity of reason and numbers.  In this decade alone we have just come to understand how far ahead Archimedes was in understanding the solar system using simple but lost ways of modeling the heavens (physical systems) and infinite continuities. Archimedes' death at the hands of the war and tax hungry Romans prevented the proliferation of calculus by almost 2000 years creating an exponential technical deficit which is the backbone of most modern marvels. Archimedes' death is another perfect example in human history where 'darkness overcame one of the better angels of our human nature'.
